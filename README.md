# RazerSpectrumCycling
Instructions:
Download the files. Extract all of them to a new directory. Run Spectrum Cycling.exe. Go nuts.


This is just a little application i whipped up in my spare time to enable faster spectrum cycling in Razer products. All are synced. Future updates might actually include a GUI!
